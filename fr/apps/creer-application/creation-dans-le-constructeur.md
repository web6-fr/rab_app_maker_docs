# Cr√©ation dans le constructeur

Soon as you log in, and have subscribed to a plan, you will be able to make a new app.

After opening the screen for creating app, for now, you can choose between 12 templates, but stay tuned, new templates are coming soon. Templates have already created an app with the basic sections \(ex: Conference template contains: agenda, the location where the conference is, buy a tickets section, social and etc\). You can add or delete a section, it's up to your needs.

Next, you have to choose a layout. For now, there are two layouts \(**tabs** and **side**\). But very soon **grid** layout will be included.

In the end, you should enter the app name and app id in the fields like in the picture below.
